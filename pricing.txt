<h3>Pricing Information</h3>


<p>Our pricing varies between clients size and need but our baseline
pricing is
 shown below. When determining cost we look at many different 
variables especially
 where you are at as a business and how we can make 
sure that our services help you
 and don't hurt your progress. 
</p>

<br>

<h4>Hourly Cost</h4>
<p>Our bookkeeping and accounting 
are both $90 per hour as a baseline price but again
 this
 will vary when it comes to the size/quantity
</p>
 

<h4>Packages (Prices Vary)</h4>

<p>
We have 5 different
 packages that are available, and they are the Small Business 
Package,
 Midsize Business Package, Large Business package, Monthly Payroll,
 and Business/Personal
Taxes. With the overall business packages (small, midsize, and large) 
we offer consultation,
taxes, and payroll so this means it has our other services combined
 and it will be made
to be unique to your company. We are making the Monthly Payroll 
and Business/Personal 
Taxes individually available for business that may not need
 to have or want the whole 
package, we also offer the Tax Package to individual 
people that want us to do their 
taxes. Last, we build our pricing off of your companies 
need, size, and demand, but we
do make sure our prices are competitive and we will not charge
 you for things you don't 
need to be charged for.
